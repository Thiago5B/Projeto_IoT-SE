    <h2>General Context</h2>
    <p>
      The project was designed to not only develop the knowledge learned in class throughout the semesters of college but also to try to solve a problem present in our lives. Because of this, from the beginning, 
      we already knew that whatever the project was, it would be based on some element or situation of the republic (student housing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about IoT control, using microcontrollers, several ideas arose, for interesting projects but that did not solve any problems, and then would probably be abandoned when the course was finished. 
      But then came the idea of controlling the garage door, which, in addition to not requiring many components besides the microcontroller, making it inexpensive, would make our lives easier.

      Therefore, initially, the project's objective is to control the opening and closing of the garage door through an MQTT protocol, so that this action can be done through the cell phone, no longer 
      by the physical control. In addition, the aim is to implement a facial recognition system using Python, so that, apart from the garage door, controlled by the cell phone, it is also possible to open 
      the pedestrian gate, but automatically, registering residents in a database.
